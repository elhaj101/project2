## Introduction
### Description
The Deer Advent Calendar is a festive website designed to celebrate the holiday season with an interactive advent calendar. Key features include:

- **Daily Surprises:** Users can engage with daily surprises and discover delightful content leading up to Christmas.
- **Special Days:** Day 6 and Day 24 have the best gifts.
- **Authenticity:** Everything is designed to look as authentic as possible, except for the coupon redeeming method to avoid legal violations. As a result, no effort was made to create a way to redeem the gifts or even imitate one.
- **Text on Cards:** 
  - Each card displays two lines of text when clicked:
    - The first line says "Sponsored by 'X'." This line is special because it gives the developer space to convey specific information related to the card's content, as it does not change upon refresh and travels with the card's content.
    - The second line features a randomly generated congratulatory message that mentions the user's name for a more personalized touch.
- **Calendar Interface:** 
  - The calendar page includes 24 cards colored red.
  - The cards vary in size and shape and are displayed randomly each time the user enters or refreshes the page.
- **Navigation:**
  - Users can only navigate to the calendar page after filling out the form with their name and clicking "Submit."
  - Users can return to the homepage by clicking on the logo in the top left corner, which turns red when hovered over.
